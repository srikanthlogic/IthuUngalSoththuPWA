  "aboutTitle": "About This Project",
  "aboutIntroTitle": "What is This App?",
  "aboutIntro1": "This project is a public effort to enhance accountability in Chennai's public transport system. By providing a live, verifiable view of the MTC fleet, we aim to empower citizens with the data they need to advocate for better services.",
  "aboutIntro2": "MTC, the public bus operator in Chennai, does not publish real-time, daily data on its fleet operations that can be independently verified. This application consumes live data to present an accurate picture of how many buses are on the road at any given time.",
  "homeFleetGapTitle": "The Fleet Discrepancy",
  "homeTheProblemIntro": "According to MTC's official (undated) data, their fleet numbers are as follows. This tracker contrasts those figures with live, verifiable data.",
  "homeOfficialFleet": "Official Fleet",
  "homeScheduledServices": "Scheduled Services",
  "homeTrackedToday": "Tracked Today",
  "homeTotalOnApp": "Total on App Datafeed",
  "homeTheProblemConclusion": "This significant gap between the officially declared fleet and the number of buses actually running is why public oversight is crucial.",
  "homeTheProblemExplanation": "The 'Total on App' figure includes every bus ID ever broadcasted by MTC's live feed. This number often includes buses that are idle for months or are deemed scrapped but have not been formally retired from the system, inflating the count of 'available' assets.",
  "homeCrewShortageTitle": "The Crew Discrepancy",
  "homeCrewIntro": "The MTC annual report cites over 2.4 million trip losses due to 'want of crew', yet the numbers suggest a significant contradiction.",
  "homeCrewOperationalNeed": "Operational Need",
  "homeCrewOfficialReport": "Official Report",
  "homeCrewBusesOperatedLabel": "MTC Buses Operated Daily",
  "homeCrewRequiredLabel": "Required Crew (Est.)",
  "homeCrewEmployedLabel": "Total Employed Crew",
  "homeCrewEmployedValue": "~19,000",
  "homeCrewTripLossLabel": "Annual Trip Losses",
  "homeCrewTripLossValue": "24 Lakh",
  "homeCrewConclusion": "Claiming 24 lakh trip losses due to 'want of crew' while having a potential surplus of ~8,000 crew members presents a major contradiction and accountability gap.",
  "homeCrewCalcTooltip": "Est. = ((MTC Buses Operated Daily √ó 2 shifts) + 250 night buses) √ó 2 crew/shift √ó 1.05 reserve factor.",
  "sourcesLabel": "Sources",

  "homeTheProblemSourceLink": "MTC Official Website",
  "homeTheProblemSourceLinkApp": "Chennai Bus App (Play Store)",
  "homeScrappedLogicTitle": "Understanding 'Deemed Scrapped' Status",
  "homeScrappedLogicBody": "In this application, a bus is deemed scrapped if its GPS tracker has not sent any updates since a user-specified date (defaulting to 60 days ago). This is an assumption to differentiate between temporarily idle buses and those that are likely no longer in service and unlikely to return.",
  "homeHelpTitle": "How This App Helps",
  "homeHelpDashboard": "Dashboard: Get a high-level, real-time overview of the entire fleet's status, including breakdowns by bus type and idle duration.",
  "homeHelpFleet": "Fleet: Dive into the raw data. Search, sort, and filter every bus in the fleet. Export your findings to CSV for further analysis.",
  "homeHelpRoutes": "Routes: Analyze the performance and fleet deployment on a per-route basis. See which routes have the most active buses and their utilization rate.",
  "homeWorldBankTitle": "The Role of International Funding & State Debt",
  "homeWorldBankIntro": "The effort to modernize Chennai's bus fleet, especially with electric buses, is supported by international loans. The World Bank, through the <a href='https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P175221' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='text-blue-600 hover:underline'>Chennai City Partnership</a>, provides funding that supports new operational models like Public Transport Service Contracts (PTSC) and Viability Gap Funding (VGF) for private operators running buses on a Gross Cost Contract (GCC) basis.",
  "homeWorldBankConclusion": "This means the quality of service you receive is financed by debt taken on by the state. That's why we say <strong>#IthuUngalSoththu - This Is Your Asset.</strong> It is not anyone‚Äôs ancestral property, nor is it merely our asset to use. These are assets financed by debt we are placing on our children. Therefore, ensuring accountability is more than a fiscal responsibility‚Äîit is a moral duty to the next generation.",

  "homeBusOpsAccountabilityTitle": "Bus Operations and Accountability",
  "homeGccOpsText": "<h4 class=\"text-md font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2\">GCC Fleet Accountability (Private Operator)</h4><p>Under the <strong>Gross Cost Contract (GCC)</strong> model, a private company operates the buses. The government pays them a fixed rate per kilometer run (reportedly <strong>‚Çπ77/km</strong> for Chennai), subsidized by state debt. üí∏</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 !mt-2\"><li>This per-km payment makes it <strong>absolutely crucial</strong> to track every kilometer. Without transparent, verifiable data, there is a risk of paying for 'ghost trips' or under-utilized buses.</li><li>The frequent 'off-grid' status of these buses means public funds are disbursed with <strong>inadequate public oversight</strong>.</li></ul>",
  "homeOwnedFleetText": "<h4 class=\"text-md font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2\">Owned Fleet Accountability (MTC Operated)</h4><p>For buses owned and operated directly by MTC, the accountability issue is different but equally critical: ü§î</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-2 !mt-2\"><li>Idle buses are <strong>assets paid for by the public</strong>, sitting unused in depots. This is a failure to deliver public service on government investment.</li><li>This directly impacts social welfare schemes.
