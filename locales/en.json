  "aboutTitle": "About This Project",
  "aboutIntroTitle": "What is This App?",
  "aboutIntro1": "This project is a public effort to enhance accountability in Chennai's public transport system. By providing a live, verifiable view of the MTC fleet, we aim to empower citizens with the data they need to advocate for better services.",
  "aboutIntro2": "MTC, the public bus operator in Chennai, does not publish real-time, daily data on its fleet operations that can be independently verified. This application consumes live data to present an accurate picture of how many buses are on the road at any given time.",
  "homeFleetGapTitle": "The Fleet Discrepancy",
  "homeTheProblemIntro": "According to MTC's official (undated) data, their fleet numbers are as follows. This tracker contrasts those figures with live, verifiable data.",
  "homeOfficialFleet": "Official Fleet",
  "homeScheduledServices": "Scheduled Services",
  "homeTrackedToday": "Tracked Today",
  "homeTotalOnApp": "Total on App Datafeed",
  "homeTheProblemConclusion": "This significant gap between the officially declared fleet and the number of buses actually running is why public oversight is crucial.",
  "homeTheProblemExplanation": "The 'Total on App' figure includes every bus ID ever broadcasted by MTC's live feed. This number often includes buses that are idle for months or are potentially scrapped but have not been formally retired from the system, inflating the count of 'available' assets.",
  "homeCrewShortageTitle": "The Crew Discrepancy",
  "homeCrewIntro": "The MTC annual report cites over 2.4 million trip losses due to 'want of crew', yet the numbers suggest a significant contradiction.",
  "homeCrewBusesOperatedLabel": "Buses Operated Daily",
  "homeCrewBusesOperatedValue": "~2,500",
  "homeCrewRequiredLabel": "Required Crew (Est.)",
  "homeCrewRequiredValue": "~11,000",
  "homeCrewEmployedLabel": "Total Employed Crew",
  "homeCrewEmployedValue": "~19,000",
  "homeCrewTripLossLabel": "Annual Trip Losses",
  "homeCrewTripLossValue": "24 Lakh",
  "homeCrewConclusion": "Claiming 24 lakh trip losses due to 'want of crew' while having a potential surplus of ~8,000 crew members presents a major contradiction and accountability gap.",
  "homeCrewCalcTooltip": "Est. based on ~2,500 day buses (2 shifts) + 250 night buses (1 shift) + 5% reserve for absenteeism.",
  "sourcesLabel": "Sources",
  "homeCrewShortageSourceLink": "MTC 52nd Annual Report 2023-24",

  "homeTheProblemSourceLinkApp": "Chennai Bus App (Play Store)",
  "homeScrappedLogicTitle": "Understanding Fleet Status",
  "homeScrappedLogicBody": "In this application, a bus is deemed 'Scrapped' if its GPS tracker has not sent any updates since a user-specified date (defaulting to 30 days ago). This is an assumption made to differentiate between buses that are temporarily idle (e.g., for maintenance, shift changes) and those that are likely no longer in service. This provides a more realistic view of the actively maintained fleet.",
  "homeHelpTitle": "How This App Helps",
  "homeHelpDashboard": "Dashboard: Get a high-level, real-time overview of the entire fleet's status, including breakdowns by bus type and idle duration.",
  "homeHelpFleet": "Fleet: Dive into the raw data. Search, sort, and filter every bus in the fleet. Export your findings to CSV for further analysis.",
  "homeHelpRoutes": "Routes: Analyze the performance and fleet deployment on a per-route basis. See which routes have the most active buses and their utilization rate.",
